      <p>At De Boer Tool we're always investing in new technology. We have the latest generation of tool and cutter grinders, and the most advanced CNC quality monitoring and inspection equipment available. Now we're proud to announce the arrival of our next quantum leap: The Pi411 Coating Center from Platit.</p>
      <p>This new coating center is a first for us, and a first for Canadian cutting tool manufacturers. With this new QuadCoating technology we can provide first-in-class coatings that give you longer tool life, better speeds and feeds, and give you an edge over your competitors.</p>
      <p>The Pi411 expands on our existing 2-cathode process, providing 4-cathode coating, allowing us to design superior coatings to meet your machining needs.</p>
      <p>We're announcing 4 new coatings as well, each one with a particular focus in mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tekna Pro</strong> - The next generation of our Tekna coating. Designed for high speeds and feeds in tough materials. The P20 Pro line and X-Mill lines will feature Tekna Pro.</li>
        <li><strong>All-4</strong> - A general purpose coating, a new iteration on our existing TiAlN coating. Our Standard (Blue Line) will feature All-4.</li>
        <li><strong>TiXCo4</strong> - A completely new coating with hard materials and rapid machining in mind. Our High Velocity line will feature TiXCo4.</li>
        <li><strong>TiB2</strong> - A sputtered coating for aluminum milling. Where the old ZrN coatings emphasized tool life over surface finish, TiB2 has both great tool life and is capable of providing fantastic surface finishes. Our A-Mill line will feature TiB2.</li>
      </ul>
